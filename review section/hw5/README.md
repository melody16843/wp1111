# Web Programming HW#5
## Basics Requirements
### Start Game
Once pressing down the "start game" button, a random number will be generated by server, and the game will start.
### Guess
Once the number being entered and the "guess" button being pressed, the guessed number will be passed to backend. If the number is not between 1 to 100 or the input is invalid, server will throw an error with status(406). If the number you guessed is bigger than the answer, server will send the message "Smaller" to frontend to ask user to enter a smaller number, vice versa. Otherwise, if the guessed number equals the answer, server will send "Equal" and the game ends with a restart button displayed on the window.
### Restart
Once the "restart" being pressed, "hasWon" will be set to false, "number" and "status" will be set to empty string.
